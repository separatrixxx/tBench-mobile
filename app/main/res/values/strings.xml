    <string name="a1">If you forgot your password for some reason, you can always reset it and come up with a new one. To do this, log out of your account. You will be taken to the login window. Below the e-mail line is the "Forgot password?" Button. Click on it and enter your e-mail. Then follow the instructions in the email you receive.</string>
    <string name="a2">In order to recover a deleted account, try logging into it. You will be taken to the page of the deleted account, where you will need to click on the "Restore" button. After that, your account will be restored. I would like to note that deleted accounts do not have a recovery period, that is, you can recover it even after a very long period of time.</string>
    <string name="a3">Only one tBench account can be linked to one e-mail address. Even if you deleted the old account, you will not be able to create a new one to this address. How to completely delete an account is written on the Help page.</string>
    <string name="a4">You cannot replace the e-mail address to which your tBench account is linked.</string>
    <string name="a5">If you deleted the message, you cannot recover it. Unfortunately, there are things in the world that cannot be fixed or returned. And trust us, deleted messages are not the most valuable of them. Next time, try to think before deleting something. And if you still delete them, do not be discouraged because of this, because life will not end there)</string>
    <string name="a6">Verification is a confirmation that a real person or organization is behind the profile. Famous people (musicians, athletes, actors) or large companies and organizations can get it. The main criterion for getting a tick is publication in the media or on the Internet. If you are a famous person or organization, write to the tBench team at tbenchteam@gmail.com</string>
    <string name="a7">In order to join the tBench team, you must have some skills that may be useful to us. Whether you are a programmer, designer or economist who wants to join developing projects, write to tbenchteam@gmail.com and we will definitely answer you!</string>
    <string name="a9">You can delete your page on the account edit page. If you want to completely delete your account without the possibility of restoring it, write to tbenchteam@gmail.com</string>
    <string name="a8">At the moment, it is impossible to block or otherwise restrict the access of other users to your page. If this is someone you know, ask him to stop texting you. We believe that any misunderstanding can be resolved with words. If this is a scammer or a person who somehow offends you, write to tbenchteam@gmail.com, we can remove this user from tBench.</string>
    <string name="a10">You can find another user using his/her name. To do this, enter part or all of the name in the search bar. Unfortunately, one nickname is not enough to find a user. If you know him personally, try asking him for his name. If he doesn\'t tell you it, then most likely he just doesn\'t want to communicate with you. But don\'t be discouraged, as you can find many other interesting people in tBench)</string>
    <string name="a11">You cannot completely delete a conversation with another user. This is for security reasons, as you cannot return it. However, you can delete all messages individually. But remember that it is impossible to recover deleted messages.</string>
    <string name="a12">Unfortunately, tBench does not yet have a message search function.</string>
    <string name="a13">To record a voice message, click on the microphone icon next to the message entry line. Next, clearly say the text of the message that you want to send to another user. The text will be written in the default language format on your device. Your speech is converted to text and you can send it to another user.</string>
    <string name="a14">You cannot write a message to a remote user. However, you can contact and speak with him personally.</string>
    <string name="a15">Unfortunately, you cannot forward messages to other users. However, you can attach a screenshot of the correspondence. But remember that not everyone likes it when his messages are read by people to whom it was not addressed.</string>

    <string name="any_questions">If you still have any questions, write to tbenchteam@gmail.com and we will do our best to help you. Thank you for helping us be better for you!</string>
